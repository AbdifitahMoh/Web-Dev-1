<ins>Today</ins> I tried to bake cookies,and lets just say things didn't go as planned. I followed the recipe, but somehow, <del>they turned into burnt rocks</del>. I even check the <abbr title="World Health Organization" > WHO </abbr> website, hoping they'd have tips on "cookie Health" but sadly, no luck. I set the oven to 350°F, but somehow I think it went up to 500 <sup> °F</sup>! after only a few mins, I saw smoke and decided to check. they were <small>tiny</small>, hard, and definitely not edible.
<progress value="22" max="100" > </progress > this is my current "baking skill" a lot of progess needed I guess. <hr> Maybe next time, i'll stick to not baking.
